The project is designed to serve as a practical application of fundamental data structures and algorithms. The system manages book inventory, customer data, and order processing through a command-line interface. This report covers the system's design, architecture, implementation, and a thorough evaluation of its performance and limitations. The analysis includes an examination of the data structures employed, such as ArrayLists, LinkedLists, and Queues, as well as the searching and sorting algorithms that form the core of the system's functionality. The report concludes with a summary of the project's academic value and potential avenues for future development.</p><h2>1. Introduction</h2><h3>1.1. Background and Motivation</h3><p>The management of inventory, customer information, and transactions in a retail environment provides a classic problem domain for the application of computer science principles. This project, an Online Bookstore Order Processing System, was developed to demonstrate the effective use of data structures and algorithms in solving such real-world problems. The primary motivation is to provide a clear and understandable example of how theoretical concepts in computer science can be applied to build a functional and efficient software system.</p><h3>1.2. System Objectives</h3><p>The main objectives of this project are:</p><ul><li>To design and implement a robust system for managing an online bookstore.</li><li>To demonstrate the practical application of various data structures, including arrays, linked lists, and queues.</li><li>To implement and evaluate the performance of different searching and sorting algorithms.</li><li>To provide a clear and well-documented codebase that can serve as a learning resource.</li></ul><h3>1.3. Scope and Limitations</h3><p>The scope of this project is to create a fully functional console-based application that allows users to perform essential bookstore operations. This includes functionalities for both customers (browsing books, placing orders) and administrators (managing books, users, and orders). The system is designed to be a standalone application running in a single-user environment. The primary limitations include the lack of a graphical user interface, the use of a simple file-based data storage system, and the absence of advanced features such as concurrent user access and secure password storage.</p><h2>2. System Architecture and Design</h2><h3>2.1. Software Architecture</h3><p>The system is designed using a layered architectural pattern, which separates the application's concerns into distinct logical layers. This promotes modularity, maintainability, and scalability. The main layers are:</p><ul><li><b>Presentation Layer:</b> Implemented through the `App.java` and controller classes, this layer is responsible for handling user input and displaying output via the console.</li><li><b>Business Logic Layer:</b> The service classes form this layer, encapsulating the core business logic of the application, such as order processing and user authentication.</li><li><b>Data Access Layer:</b> This layer is responsible for handling data storage and retrieval from the CSV files. The service classes currently also handle this responsibility.</li></ul><h3>2.2. Data Storage</h3><p>The application employs a file-based data storage mechanism, utilizing Comma-Separated Values (CSV) files to persist data. The primary data entities—books, users, and orders—are stored in `books.csv`, `users.csv`, and `orders.csv`, respectively. While this approach is simple to implement, it has inherent limitations in terms of scalability, data integrity, and concurrent access when compared to a relational database management system (RDBMS).</p><h3>2.3. Data Structures</h3><p>The choice of data structures is critical to the system's performance and functionality. The following data structures are employed:</p><ul><li><b>ArrayList:</b> This dynamic array is the primary data structure for storing collections of objects, such as the list of all books, users, and orders. It offers O(1) time complexity for random access, making it efficient for retrieving elements by their index.</li><li><b>LinkedList:</b> A custom generic `LinkedList<T>` class has been implemented. This data structure consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a data element and a reference to the next node in the sequence. It is used as the underlying data structure for the Queue implementation.</li><li><b>Queue:</b> A generic `Queue<T>` class, implemented using the custom `LinkedList`, is utilized for managing the order processing workflow. The queue operates on a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, ensuring that orders are processed in the sequence they are received.</li></ul><h2>3. Implementation Details</h2><h3>3.1. Core Modules</h3><p>The system is organized into several core modules, each responsible for a specific set of functionalities:</p><ul><li><b>Book Module:</b> Manages the bookstore's inventory.</li><li><b>User Module:</b> Handles user registration, authentication, and management.</li><li><b>Order Module:</b> Responsible for creating, processing, and tracking customer orders.</li><li><b>Utils Module:</b> Provides a collection of utility classes, including the implementations of various data structures and algorithms.</li></ul><h3>3.2. Algorithm Implementation</h3><h4>3.2.1. Searching Algorithms</h4><p>The system primarily relies on <b>Linear Search</b> for its search operations. This algorithm iterates through a collection of items sequentially until a match is found or the end of the collection is reached. While simple to implement, its O(n) time complexity can be inefficient for large datasets.</p><h4>3.2.2. Sorting Algorithms</h4><p>The application implements a variety of sorting algorithms to organize the book data based on different criteria:</p><ul><li><b>Insertion Sort:</b> Used for sorting books by title.</li><li><b>Selection Sort:</b> Employed for sorting books by author.</li><li><b>Quick Sort:</b> Utilized for sorting books by price.</li><li><b>Merge Sort:</b> Implemented for sorting books by their unique ID.</li></ul><h2>4. Evaluation and Analysis</h2><h3>4.1. Complexity Analysis</h3><h4>4.1.1. Time Complexity</h4><ul><li><b>Searching (Linear Search):</b> O(n)</li><li><b>Sorting:</b></li><ul><li>Insertion Sort: O(n^2)</li><li>Selection Sort: O(n^2)</li><li>Quick Sort: O(n log n) on average, O(n^2) in the worst case.</li><li>Merge Sort: O(n log n)</li></ul><li><b>Queue Operations (enqueue, dequeue):</b> O(1)</li></ul><h4>4.1.2. Space Complexity</h4><ul><li><b>Data Storage (ArrayLists):</b> O(n)</li><li><b>Sorting:</b></li><ul><li>Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort: O(1) (in-place)</li><li>Merge Sort: O(n)</li></ul><li><b>Queue (LinkedList-based):</b> O(n)</li></ul><h3>4.2. Performance Assumptions</h3><p>The choice of algorithms was guided by a set of performance assumptions, as detailed in the project's `README.md` file. These assumptions include the expected size of the book inventory (around 5,000 books), the number of customers, and the daily order volume. These assumptions justify the use of simpler algorithms like linear search, which are acceptable for datasets of this size.</p><h3>4.3. Limitations of the Current Implementation</h3><ul><li><b>Scalability:</b> The use of linear search and file-based storage limits the system's ability to scale to larger datasets.</li><li><b>User Interface:</b> The console-based interface is not as intuitive or user-friendly as a graphical user interface (GUI).</li><li><b>Concurrency:</b> The system is not designed to handle multiple users concurrently.</li><li><b>Security:</b> Passwords are stored in plain text, which is a significant security vulnerability.</li></ul><h2>5. Conclusion and Future Work</h2><h3>5.1. Conclusion</h3><p>The Online Bookstore Order Processing System successfully demonstrates the practical application of fundamental data structures and algorithms in a real-world context. The project achieves its objectives of providing a functional, well-structured, and educational example of software development principles. The analysis of the system's performance and limitations provides valuable insights into the trade-offs involved in choosing different data structures and algorithms.</p><h3>5.2. Future Work</h3><p>Future enhancements to the system could include:</p><ul><li><b>Database Integration:</b> Migrating from file-based storage to a relational database to improve scalability and data integrity.</li><li><b>Graphical User Interface:</b> Developing a GUI to enhance the user experience.</li><li><b>Web-based Application:</b> Transforming the project into a web application to allow for wider accessibility.</li><li><b>Enhanced Search Capabilities:</b> Implementing more efficient search algorithms, such as hashing or indexed search.</li><li><b>Security Enhancements:</b> Incorporating password hashing and other security best practices.</li></ul></body></html>
